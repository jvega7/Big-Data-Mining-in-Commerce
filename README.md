# Big-Data-Mining-in-Commerce
We will be finding the correlations between purchased products and suggest other products that pertain to the correlated items. We will look at which item attribute is the best to compare to other product, in order to find the best correlation. In return we will improve the data mining capabilities to suggest for users their next item to purchase.
